#' PSMOptimalCalipers: Reproduces and Extends Simulations on Optimal Caliper Width in Propensity-Score Matching
#'
#' This package reproduces and extends figure 2 from the 2011 paper
#' paper 'Optimal caliper widths for propensity-score matching when estimating differences
#' in means and differences in proportions in observational studies' by Peter C. Austin.
#' Figure 2 examines the MSE of the predicted risk differences when using 50 different
#' propensity-score caliper widths from 0.05 to 2.5. The simulations all have 25 percent
#' treated patients and 75 percent control patients. We will extend these simulations by
#' varying the percentage of treated patients.
