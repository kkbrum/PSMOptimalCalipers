#' Results of simulation extending Austin 2011 paper figure 2
#'
#' A dataset containing simulation results to analyze the
#' risk differences obtained using different caliper widths
#' in propensity score matching, with a treated proportion
#' of 0.35.
#'
#' @format A list with 5 elements, where each element contains the
#' results for simulations based on a different covariate distribution:
#' \describe{
#'     \item{Ind Norm}{All 10 covariates generated are independent
#'     standard normals}
#'     \item{Corr Norm}{10 covariates generated are standard normals
#'     with pairwise correlation 0.25}
#'     \item{5 Bern}{5 covariates are independent Bernouillis with
#'     success probability 0.5 and the other 5 covariates are
#'     independent standard normals}
#'     \item{9 Bern}{9 covariates are independent Bernouillis with
#'     success probability 0.5 and the other covariate is a
#'     standard normal}
#'     \item{10 Bern}{All 10 covariates generated are independent
#'     Bernouillis with success probability 0.5}
#'     }
#' Each of these elements is a list with one component, containing
#' the simulation results for a true risk difference of -0.05:
#' \describe{
#'    \item{RD -0.05}{A matrix with 25 columns where each column
#'    is for a new caliper width and 7 rows:
#'    \describe{
#'        \item{gamma}{The caliper width in terms of number of
#'        standard deviations of the logit propensity score}
#'        \item{MSE}{Mean squared error of the calculated risk
#'        differences across 500 data sets}
#'        \item{bias_reduction}{The percentage the propensity
#'        score estimate reduced bias over the crude full data
#'        estimate}
#'        \item{mean_crude}{The crude average risk difference
#'        estimated across the 500 data sets}
#'        \item{mean_ps}{The average risk difference estimated
#'        across the 500 data sets comparing the matched groups}
#'        \item{time_mean}{The average time to generate data,
#'        conduct matching, and calculate risk difference for
#'        one data set}
#'        \item{time_var}{The variance across the 500 data sets
#'        of the time to generate data, conduct matching, and
#'        calculate risk difference for one data set}
#'        }
#'    }
