Description: Reproduces and extends figure 2 from the 2011 paper 
    paper 'Optimal caliper widths for propensity-score matching when estimating differences 
    in means and differences in proportions in observational studies' by Peter C. Austin. 
    Figure 2 examines the MSE of the predicted risk differences when using 50 different
    propensity-score caliper widths from 0.05 to 2.5. The simulations all have 25 percent
    treated patients and 75 percent control patients. We will extend these simulations by
    varying the percentage of treated patients.
